* Executables *

test.py : demo executable, runs without argument

accuracy_study.py: runs without argument, used to study influence of speficic meta-parameters on the test error for our implementation and PyTorch
performance_study.py: runs without argument, used to time the performance of our implementation and of that of PyTorch as a function of the batch size
